    \textit{Look around:} While in normal 3D mode the tester shall click the screen and drag first up to move the camera up.
    Then move down to move the camera down, then at last left and then right, all the time the camera must follow the movement of the finger.
    After this the tester shall tilt the phone up to move the camera up, then tilt it down, left and right. The camera shall follow the tilt direction of the phone all the time with no delay.

    This test shall be repeated in stereoscopic 3D view. While the clicking and dragging shall not work, the tilting of the phone shall be the only way to pan the camera.

    \textit{Move inside VR-World:} While in normal 3D mode the tester shall tilt the joystick on the controller forward and the camera shall move forward.
    By tilting the joystick backward the camera shall move back, by tilting left the camera shall move left and by tilting right it shall move right.
    The camera shall allways follow the view point, so forward is allways in the center of the camera.

    This test shall be again repeated in stereoscopic 3D view and all functions shall work the same.
